# Walmart Stores Analysis

Repository containing analysis of Walmart stores data.

## Overview

he goal of this project is to cluster Walmart stores based on various metrics such as weekly sales, store size, economic factors (like CPI and unemployment rate), and store type. By clustering the stores, we aim to identify groups of stores with similar characteristics and understand what factors contribute to their performance.

## Data

The dataset used for this analysis includes:
- **Weekly Sales**: Total sales made by each store per week.
- **Size**: Size of each store in square feet.
- **Temperature**: Average temperature in the region of each store.
- **Fuel Price**: Cost of fuel in the region.
- **CPI**: Consumer Price Index, a measure of inflation.
- **Unemployment**: Unemployment rate in the region.
- **Dept**: Department within the store.
- **Type**: Type of store (e.g., Type A, B, C).
